## 🎓 How I Got QTS Certified in the UK"

Way back in 2016, I made the leap into the world of education as a private tutor, and it’s one of the best decisions I made. 3 years later I made an even better decision and got certified as a teacher. If you're thinking about becoming a teacher and wondering how to get **Qualified Teacher Status (QTS)** in the UK, here’s what I learned from going through the process myself.

## 🛤️ Which Route I Took

As a career changer, I didn’t want to go back to uni for another three years — I was only three years out of university! I decided I needed something focused and practical. I chose the **Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) with QTS**, a 1-year full-time course that combines academic learning with real classroom teaching.

There are other routes, too:

- **Assessment Only (AO)** — great if you’ve already been working in schools for a couple of years without formal training.
- **SCITT (School-Centred Initial Teacher Training)** — very hands-on and school-based, often with QTS included.
- **iQTS or direct QTS application** — if you’re coming from abroad.

## ⏳ Duration

Most PGCE with QTS courses take **1 academic year full-time**, or **up to 2 years part-time**. The Assessment Only route is much quicker — usually wrapped up within **12 weeks** — but it's only an option if you’ve got at least two years of solid teaching experience.

## 💷 Costs (and Funding Options)

Here's what I paid (and how I managed):

- **Tuition**: Around **£9,250** for the PGCE.
- **Living costs**: I applied for a **student maintenance loan** and qualified for a **bursary** (which varies depending on the subject — maths, physics, and computing often have the highest ones).
- Many people also get help from **career change support programs**, like *Now Teach* or *Transition to Teach*.

If you’re doing Assessment Only, costs are lower — typically **£2,000–£4,000**, but there’s usually no funding available for that route.

## 📍 Where to Study

There are lots of providers, so it’s worth doing your homework. A few standouts:

- **Universities**: UCL (where I studied for my QTS), University of Manchester, University of East Anglia (where I studied for my degree!)
- **SCITT programmes**: Based in schools, very practical
- **Tes Institute**, **University of Buckingham**, or **Sunderland**: Some offer flexible or online options


Look for something that suits your style — whether you’re more academically minded or learn best by doing.

## 🎓 Why QTS Was Worth It

Getting QTS gave me the professional recognition I needed to teach in state schools. But more than that, it gave me confidence, structure, and a deeper understanding of teaching.
