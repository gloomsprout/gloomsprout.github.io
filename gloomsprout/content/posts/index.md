# Why My QTS Matters for Your Child’s Tutoring Success

Hello! I’m a private tutor with **Qualified Teacher Status (QTS)**—and while I’m not standing in a school classroom every day, the training and experience that come with QTS are at the heart of everything I do when I work with your child.

You might be wondering: _“Does it really matter if my child’s tutor has QTS?”_  
Let me explain why it does—and how it benefits your child, especially if you’re looking for more than just help with homework.

## What Is QTS?

QTS stands for **Qualified Teacher Status**, and it’s the professional certification that teachers in England and Wales must have to work in most state schools.

To gain QTS, I completed **rigorous teacher training**, learned how to adapt to different learning needs, passed multiple classroom assessments, and trained in safeguarding and child development. It’s not just about knowing the subject—it’s about knowing how to teach it effectively, safely, and in a way that supports long-term progress.

## How That Helps Your Child as a Tutor

### 1. I Know the Curriculum—Inside and Out  
Because of my QTS training and experience, I’m confident navigating the national curriculum at every level—from phonics and SATs to GCSEs and A-Levels. I won’t just help your child “get through their work”—I’ll help them truly understand what they’re learning, and **why** it matters.

### 2. I Teach, Not Just Explain  
Being a tutor with QTS means I bring full teaching strategies into our sessions. I don’t just go through answers—I build your child’s confidence, develop their independent thinking, and help them overcome the “I’m just not good at this” mindset.

### 3. I’m Trained to Support Additional Needs  
If your child has **dyslexia, ADHD, autism, or struggles with anxiety**, you’ll want someone who understands how to adapt their approach. With QTS, I’ve had formal training in **special educational needs** (SEND), behaviour management, and building a safe and supportive learning environment.

### 4. You Can Trust the Standards I Work To  
My QTS status means:
- I’ve passed enhanced **DBS checks**
- I follow **safeguarding guidelines**
- I work to **national teaching standards**

You don’t have to wonder if I’m qualified—I’m held to the same professional bar as every classroom teacher.

### 5. I Focus on Long-Term Growth, Not Quick Fixes  
Lots of tutors can help a student cram for a test. I do that too—but I also focus on helping your child become a more **confident, capable learner** who can approach future challenges with resilience.

## In Summary

Hiring a tutor with QTS means your child gets the benefit of **qualified teaching expertise**, but in a **1-to-1 setting tailored to their needs**. Whether your child is falling behind, struggling with confidence, or aiming to excel, my goal is to support them with care, structure, and professional insight.

If you’d like to chat about how I can help your child thrive—whether it’s in maths, English, or general study support—feel free to get in touch. I’d be happy to discuss your child’s needs and how I can support them.

Warm regards,
