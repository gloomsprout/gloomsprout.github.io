Hi, I’m Rhian. I hold a degree in English and American Literature from the University of East Anglia (2:1, 2013) and a Primary PGCE from UCL. With over eight years of tutoring experience and a background in both mainstream and SEND schools, I provide tailored support to help students build confidence and reach their full potential.

I’ve tutored children as young as three, supporting early years development, all the way up to GCSE students preparing for exams. I’ve worked with learners of all abilities—from those who need additional support to those aiming for top grades. My experience includes one-to-one tuition, small group sessions, and supporting students with special educational needs.

I have a strong understanding of both the primary and secondary curriculum and offer tutoring in phonics, SATs preparation, entrance exams, GCSE revision, and key skills such as comprehension, reading, writing, grammar, punctuation, and a range of maths topics. I adapt my teaching to suit different learning styles, ensuring lessons are engaging, structured, and effective.

I’m passionate about making learning accessible and enjoyable, especially for students who need extra support. Whether it’s reinforcing core skills, preparing for exams, or building confidence, I create a positive and encouraging learning environment to help every student succeed.
