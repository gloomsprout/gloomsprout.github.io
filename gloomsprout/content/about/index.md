My journey as an educator began with a degree in English and American Literature from the University of East Anglia, where I developed a deep appreciation for language, storytelling, and the power of communication: I even wrote for the school newspaper! But it was my passion for helping young people grow, both academically and emotionally, that led me into teaching and, ultimately, private tutoring.

Over the past 8 years, I’ve worked as a private tutor supporting students across both primary and secondary levels. I have also spent 5 years in the classroom as a qualified teacher (QTS), building a strong foundation in curriculum planning, inclusive teaching strategies, and student support.

I specialise in creating calm, nurturing learning environments where every student feels seen, heard, and capable—especially those with additional needs such as ADHD, autism, and dyslexia. With 4 years’ experience supporting SEND learners, I understand how to tailor lessons to different abilities, learning styles, and personalities.

My teaching style is patient, structured, and highly adaptable. Whether your child is preparing for exams, catching up on missed learning, or simply needs a confidence boost, my goal is to help them unlock their potential in a way that feels safe, supportive, and encouraging.

Education is about more than academic success; it's about building resilience, curiosity, and self-belief. That’s why I work closely with the parents to create a joined-up approach to learning, grounded in care and collaboration.

Lessons are available online or in-person (based in W5), and I’m enhanced DBS checked.

If you're looking for a tutor who leads with empathy, clarity, and a commitment to lifelong learning, I’d love to hear from you.
