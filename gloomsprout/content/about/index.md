I’m a caring and experienced private tutor who supports both primary and secondary school students in building confidence and reaching their full potential.

 I specialise in creating calm, supportive learning environments tailored to each child’s needs—including those with additional learning needs such as ADHD, autism, and dyslexia. 
 
 With a gentle, patient approach and a strong understanding of the curriculum, I help students feel seen, heard, and capable—whether they’re catching up, preparing for exams, or simply needing a boost. 
 
 Learning should feel safe and encouraging, and that’s what I aim to provide in every session.
